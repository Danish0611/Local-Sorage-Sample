# WEB - Masai E-Commerce with LS



### Problem Statement:-

- In this application, we have 2 different pages:-
  1. index.html(Home Page)
  2. cart.html(Cart Page)

#### index.html(Home Page):-
- At first make an API request with fetch in this API end-point:- 
`https://dbioz2ek0e.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mockapi/get-tech-products`.
- If you successfully do that you will get some e-commerce product data(Array of Objects).
- In the template, there is a div with an id:- `product-container`.
- You have to loop over the data and create small cards based on the data and append them to the above-mentioned div.
- Show 4 cards per row with a display grid.

- Here we also have a select tag with an id:- `filter`.
- Using this select tag you should be able to filter the products with their category.
- Use array.filter method to filter the products by their category.
- Each Product card should have a button with the text:- `Add To Cart`.
- When clicked on this button that product data should be added to local storage with a key `cart`.
- The user should not be able to add the same product to the cart multiple times.
- If adding to cart is successful show an alert with the text:- `Product Added To Cart` else show an alert with the text:- `Product Already in Cart`.


#### cart.html(Cart Page):-
- In this page all the data will come from the localstorage with key `cart`.
- Loop over the localstorage data and show them in smaller cards inside and div with id:- `cart-container`(Given in the template).
- Now each of the cards also have a span tag where you can see the quantity of the product. By default the quantity should be 1.
- there are also two buttons and using them you can increment/decrement the quantity.
- Each card should also have a button with text `Remove`. Clicking on that this particular cart should be deleted.
- Please follow this structure for the cards:-

```
<div>
<img src="image">
 <h2>Brand</h2>
 <h3>Price</h3>
 <p>Details</p>
 <p>Category</p>
 <button>+</button> -> increment button
 <span>quantity</span>
<button>-</button> -> decrement button
<button>Remove</button> -> Remove button
</div>
```
- Please make sure all the buttons have the same text as the given structure.
- In the template we also have a span tag with id:- `cart-total`.
- Here you have to show the total value of the cart.
- Make sure whenever the quantity gets modified the total price is updated. (Total is= sum of (quantity*price) of all products in cart).
- Please take a look at the below image for better understanding:-
